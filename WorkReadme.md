## Version 0.00001 - Project Foundation & Autoload Architecture
**Date:** Previous Session  
**Focus:** Establishing project structure and autoload singleton hierarchy

### Tasks:
- [x] Project folder structure
- [x] Autoload hierarchy design  
- [x] Autoload singleton implementations

### Status: Completed
Successfully created complete project foundation with 8 autoload singletons in proper dependency order.

## Current Development Phase

### Phase 1: Project Foundation ✅
- [x] Project folder structure
- [x] Autoload hierarchy design
- [x] Core architecture documentation
- [x] Autoload singleton implementations
- [ ] Core Resource class definitions
- [ ] Base component interfaces
- [ ] Scene templates

### Phase 2: Core Systems
- [ ] GameManager implementation
- [ ] InventorySystem implementation
- [ ] EconomySystem implementation
- [ ] CraftingSystem implementation
- [ ] PlayerData implementation

### Phase 3: Component Architecture
- [ ] Patron component system
- [ ] Interactable systems
- [ ] Scene entry points

## Architecture Decisions

### Autoload Dependency Order
1. DataManager (base persistence)
2. PlayerData (player progression)
3. InventorySystem (item management)
4. EconomySystem (currency system)
5. CraftingSystem (wine crafting)
6. PatronManager (patron AI)
7. SceneManager (scene transitions)
8. GameManager (core game state)

### Design Principles
- SOLID principles implementation
- Clean code standards (20-line max functions, full typing)
- Modern Godot 4 practices
- Component-based architecture
- Signal-driven communication
- Resource-based data modeling

## Notes
- Focus on creating rock-solid foundation for dual-loop gameplay
- Maintain clean, professional code standards throughout
- Ensure extensibility for future patron types and wine recipes
- Prioritize maintainability and testability
