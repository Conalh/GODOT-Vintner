# Hemovintner Development Work Log

## Version History

### Version 0.00001 - Project Foundation & Autoload Architecture
- Created complete project folder structure
- Designed autoload singleton hierarchy with proper dependency order
- Implemented project.godot with autoload configurations
- Established core architecture documentation
- Set up folder organization for hub-and-spoke scene architecture
- Prepared foundation for cross-scene data persistence
- Designed bar income banking system architecture
- Implemented all 8 autoload singletons with proper dependency management
- Created comprehensive game constants and enums
- Established SOLID principles and clean code architecture

## Current Development Phase

### Phase 1: Project Foundation âœ…
- [x] Project folder structure
- [x] Autoload hierarchy design
- [x] Core architecture documentation
- [x] Autoload singleton implementations
- [ ] Core Resource class definitions
- [ ] Base component interfaces
- [ ] Scene templates

### Phase 2: Core Systems
- [ ] GameManager implementation
- [ ] InventorySystem implementation
- [ ] EconomySystem implementation
- [ ] CraftingSystem implementation
- [ ] PlayerData implementation

### Phase 3: Component Architecture
- [ ] Patron component system
- [ ] Interactable systems
- [ ] Scene entry points

## Architecture Decisions

### Autoload Dependency Order
1. DataManager (base persistence)
2. PlayerData (player progression)
3. InventorySystem (item management)
4. EconomySystem (currency system)
5. CraftingSystem (wine crafting)
6. PatronManager (patron AI)
7. SceneManager (scene transitions)
8. GameManager (core game state)

### Design Principles
- SOLID principles implementation
- Clean code standards (20-line max functions, full typing)
- Modern Godot 4 practices
- Component-based architecture
- Signal-driven communication
- Resource-based data modeling

## Notes
- Focus on creating rock-solid foundation for dual-loop gameplay
- Maintain clean, professional code standards throughout
- Ensure extensibility for future patron types and wine recipes
- Prioritize maintainability and testability
